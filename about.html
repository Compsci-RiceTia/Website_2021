	<p class= "about"> 
	Cole (left) sister to Tom is the creative life of our company. <br>
	She has a great palette for flavor profiles 
	<br> and always knows when <br>(much to Tom's and I's disapointment) we
	can't sell something.
	<br>
	<br>
	Tom (Middle) is my right-hand man. He loves numbers <br> and always has our checking books in order.
	We couldn't <br> do it without him!
	<br>
	<br>
	And finally me, the entrepreneur of this company!<br> We always loved cheese plates and one day I thought
	to make a <br> bussiness of it. Now look at us!
	</p>
