							<dd> 5/5 <br>
								This bussiness takes a lot of pride in their work and it shows.
								I recently brought a cheese plate to a family reunion and they loved
								it so much that I almost wanted to say I made it. Of course I led
								them to your bussiness and I can't wait to support this bussiness again.</dd>

							<dd> 4.5/5 <br>
							Wow! I was really impressed with how this bussiness presented itself.
								I bought one of the cheese plates for my girls this summer and
								they loved the cold snack. My only complaint is that I wish there
								were gluten free options!</dd>

							The food was alright. I understand the hype of this bussiness but
							I definitely would only recommend this for leisure eating.
							I've had a lot of cheese plates in my life and this one
							isn't the best but it's good for the price!<dd>

				<h2> Questions </h2>
					<dl>
						<dt> Do you have discounts? </dt>
							<dd> Unfortunately we do not have coupons at the present moment.
							If you have any trouble with pricing feel free to contact us
							and we'll see if there is anything we can do to accomodate.</dd>
	<br>
						<dt> When should I expect a shipment? </dt>
							<dd> Right now we only ship in the local area so shipments take
								8hrs to a day depending on when we start and when you need it.</dd>	
	<br>
						<dt> Why is it so expensive? </dt>
							<dd> As a small bussiness we know our prices are... beatable...
							for the lack of a better word. Although, with this price we are
							able to ethically source our ingredients and finance our workers.<dd>
